        "desc": "Kapital No. 6 Canvas Snufkin Bag - Kinari–Sally and Suanna kindly gifted me this bag to celebrate my graduation. While I am really thankful for my friends, this was a bit excessive. Since my first trip to Japan, I had been eyeing the bag but I had already dropped a bag on a jacket during that trip so I couldn’t justify dropping another bag on this bag. –Regardless, I love how interactive this bag is - it comes flat and you fasten three buckles to make it functional. It holds a lot of things, more than I expected. I am afraid to get it dirty because it is a light color. The bag was purchased from Grailed. I have had this bag since June 2025."

        "desc": "Century Denim No.9 Book Bag–I got this bag at the 2nd Street in Costa Mesa at The Camp, which is one of my favorite stores. I was with Sally on a trip to OC. It was an impulse purchase because I had never actually seen the bag before but I am glad I got it. It has Kapital’s signature sashiko stitching all throughout which adds a really nice texture. I got it for quite a good price (compared to retail in the US). –Before purchasing it, I FaceTimed Suanna and Teresa, and only Suanna was in support of me getting it. Sally really wanted me to get it because she knew if I didn’t get the bag I wouldn’t stop talking about it all night and she did NOT want to hear any of that. I am glad she had that sentiment. It goes with basically every outfit and is loud enough to let those who know that I am flexing on them, but subtle enough that the big graphic words make an otherwise plain outfit interesting to the average person. I have had this bag since January 2025. "

        "desc": "Kapital Twill Aging-Wool 1st Jacket - Faded Charcoal–This was my first Kapital piece. I bought it at the Tokyo Naked Store. I had gone to Japan with the intention of finding something in the neighborhood of a denim jacket and when I came across this one, I knew it was the one. The sales associate definitely played some tricks to get me to buy it - he said it was the only one of this size left in stores (my size was in stock online) (but I guess I couldn’t have it shipped to me anyways because we were only in Japan for a couple more days) but I do not blame him one bit. –Modeled after the Levi’s Type 1 jacket, it has all the characteristics of the jean jacket I was looking for but with a bit more warmth and less hill billy energy that fits better into my style. I love the “contrast stitching” around all the hems that give it this sort of aged look without being worn. I am scared to get it wet because it is made of wool. One time I was caught in the rain with it without an umbrella. Luckily I escaped and the jacket is fine. I hope I never have to wash it. I have had this jacket since December 2024."

        "desc": "杨 hat–Suanna knitted me this hat. The Chinese character on its face is my last name. She began working on this project a long time ago - at this point neither of us remember when. Again, I am so thankful for my friends because the time, energy, and thought that went into this is priceless. The colors on it are so fun but still subdued in a way that makes it possible to style with many different types of outfits. I love the texture that the mohair creates and the construction of it (not pictured but you just have to believe me). –I also love how cool it makes my last name look. Growing up I didn’t like how my last name sounded in English nor did I really like it in Chinese because it is homophones with the word for sheep. But it looks so dope on this hat. I can’t wait to wear it when it’s colder/when I move to New York. I have had this hat since August 2025."
