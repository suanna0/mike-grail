        Hi, I'm Michael.
        <br><br>
        I have always had an eye for beautiful things - whether they be incredible moments of design history, laboriously handcrafted garments, extraordinary natural phenomena, or just plain everyday objects.
        <br><br>
        In a world of fast moving trends and overconsumption, I am working to be more intentional about what I collect, investing in lifelong pieces that I know I will cherish forever. Updating this website periodically not only is a small nod to this shift in attitude but also serves as a way to look back on the stories each piece holds.
