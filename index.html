            –Sally and Suanna kindly gifted me this bag to celebrate my graduation (June 2025). While I am really thankful for my friends, this was a bit excessive. Since my first trip to Japan, I had been eyeing the bag but I had already dropped a bag on a jacket so I couldn’t justify dropping another bag on this bag. 
            –Regardless, I love how interactive this bag is - it comes flat and you fasten three buckles to make it functional. It holds a lot of things, more than I expected. I am afraid to get it dirty because it is a light color. The bag was purchased from Grailed. "

            –I got this bag at the 2nd Street in Costa Mesa at The Camp, which is one of my favorite stores. I was with Sally on a trip to OC. It was an impulse purchase because I had never actually seen the bag before but I am glad I got it. It has Kapital’s signature sashiko stitching all throughout which adds a really nice texture. I got it for quite a good price (compared to retail in the US). 
            –Before purchasing it, I FaceTimed Suanna and Teresa, and only Suanna was in support of me getting it. Sally really wanted me to get it because she knew if I didn’t get the bag I wouldn’t stop talking about it all night and she did NOT want to hear any of that. I am glad she had that sentiment. I have had this bag since January 2025. It goes with basically every outfit and is loud enough to let those who know that I am flexing on them, but subtle enough that the big graphic words make an otherwise plain outfit interesting to the average person.

            –This was my first Kapital piece. I bought it at the Tokyo Naked Store. I had gone to Japan with the intention of finding something in the neighborhood of a denim jacket and when I came across this one, I knew it was the one. The sales associate definitely played some tricks to get me to buy it - he said it was the only one of this size left in stores (my size was in stock online) (but I guess I couldn’t have it shipped to me anyways because we were only in Japan for a couple more days) but I do not blame him one bit. Modeled after the Levi’s Type 1 jacket, it has all the characteristics of the jean jacket I was looking for but with a bit more warmth and less hill billy energy that fits better into my style. I have had this jacket since December 2024. I love the “contrast stitching” around all the hems that give it this sort of aged look without being worn. I am scared to get it wet because it is made of wool and I was caught in the rain with it once without an umbrella. Luckily I escaped and the jacket is fine. I hope I never have to wash it. "

            –Suanna knitted me this hat. The Chinese character on its face is my last name. She began working on this project a long time ago - at this point neither of us do not remember when. Again, I am so thankful for my friends because the time, energy, and thought that went into this is priceless. The colors on it are so fun but still subdued in a way that makes it possible to style with many different types of outfits. I love the texture that the mohair creates and the construction of it (not pictured but you just have to believe me). I also love how cool it makes my last name look. Growing up I didn’t like how my last name sounded in English nor did I really like it in Chinese because it is homophones with the word for sheep. But it looks so dope on this hat. I can’t wait to wear it when it’s colder/when I move to New York. I have had this hat since August 2025."
