            –Suanna knitted me this hat. The character on its face is my last name in Chinese. She began working on this project a long time ago - at this point neither of us remember when. I am so thankful for my friends because the time, energy, and thought that went into this are priceless. 

            –Apart from the texture of the mohair and the fun colors on this hat, I also love how cool it makes my last name look. Growing up I didn’t like how my last name sounded in English, nor did I really like it in Chinese because it is a homophone of the word for sheep. But none of that matters because it looks so dope on my head. I can’t wait to wear it when it’s colder out/when I move to New York. I have had this hat since August 2025.

            –Sally and Suanna kindly gifted me this bag to celebrate my graduation. Again, I am really thankful for my friends, but this was a bit excessive. Since my first trip to Japan, I had been eyeing the bag but I had already dropped a bag on a jacket during that trip so I couldn’t justify dropping another bag on this bag. 

            –Regardless, I love how interactive this bag is - it comes flat and you fasten three buckles to make it functional. It holds a lot of things, more than I expected. I am afraid to get it dirty because it is a light color. The bag was purchased from Grailed. I have had this bag since June 2025.

            data-desc="Needles H.D. Track Pant - Poly Smooth Dark Brown
            –I first saw this kind of pant on @rydennoah’s YouTube channel. I was intrigued by their shape and construction and began doing a little bit of research on them. Eventually, I found my size on a site called HAVEN. When they came in the mail, I was a bit thrown off by the color (because they are supposedly brown - however due to color theory or perhaps the fact that they are actually just purple tinged, they appear slightly purple) but I was so excited to own a pair of the famed H.D. track pants that I kept them anyways. 
            
            –I love how huge they are and how they accentuate my dancing (when I dance in them). At first, I felt a little crazy for spending so much money on straight polyester, but I don’t feel that way anymore. I have had these pants since December 2024.

            data-desc="Kapital Twill Aging-Wool 1st Jacket - Faded Charcoal
            –This is my first Kapital piece. I bought it at the Tokyo Naked Store during my first trip to Japan. I knew I wanted to find something in the neighborhood of a denim jacket during my time there, and when I came across this piece, I knew it was the one. The sales associate definitely played some tricks to get me to buy it - he said it was the only one of its size left in stores (my size was in stock online) (I guess I couldn’t have it shipped to me anyways because we were only in Japan for a couple more days) but I do not blame him one bit. 

            –Modeled after the Levi’s Type 1 jacket, it has all the characteristics of the jean jacket I was looking for, but with a softer touch and less country Americana energy that fits better into my style. I love the contrast stitching around all the hems that give it this sort of aged look without being worn. I am scared to get it wet because it is made of wool. One time I was caught in the rain with it without an umbrella. Luckily I escaped and the jacket is fine. I hope I never have to wash it. On that trip, Suanna ended up getting the same jacket but in the red colorway in Kyoto. I have had this jacket since December 2024.

            –This piece is from 2nd Street in Stanton. That day I was only really looking for some kind of sweater because I had forgotten to bring one with me on that trip, but when I saw this piece in store, I couldn’t pass it up. I am an avid user of Google Lens and could not find anything about this piece, hence I do not know the official name of this item. 
            
            –The main reasons for my purchase were a combination of the uniqueness of the piece and the fact that it had the “original” tags on it. Afterwards, I realized that the tag fasteners for the “original” tags and the 2nd Street merchandise tag were all the same so they probably put it on themselves. 2nd Street won that day. The price was also crazy below “retail,” which further convinced me to get it. Usually, I wouldn’t go for a graphic that’s as ridiculous as the entire alphabet on my back, but the stitching on the inside of each letter was so interesting and well done that I could not pass up on the piece. The cuffs also have a sort of irregular cinching to them that I find to be a fun detail. I have had this top since June 2025.

            –LTTT recently celebrated their fourth birthday, so accordingly I had to celebrate with them by making this purchase. I was in LA on the day of their birthday party but was not near the area so I did not make it to the TikTok fashion mf meetup of the century. 
           
            –Every colorway of the pant was stunning, but I purchased the orange pair because I wanted to live out my highlighter kid dreams. It was definitely a decision, one that I don’t know if I can completely stand behind to this day, but I like to think of it as exposure therapy and embracing taking up (visual) space in the world. There are many cool details on the pants, but the panelling of various colors and materials stand out to me in particular. I have had these pants since July 2025.

            –I got this bag at 2nd Street in Costa Mesa at The Camp on a trip to OC with Sally. It was an impulse purchase because I had never actually seen the bag before but I am glad I got it. It has Kapital’s signature sashiko stitching all throughout which adds a really nice texture. The price was quite good compared to retail in the US. 
            
            –Before purchasing it, I FaceTimed Suanna and Teresa, but only Suanna was in support of me getting it. Sally really wanted me to get it because she knew if I didn’t get the bag I wouldn’t stop talking about it all night and she did NOT want to hear any of that. I am glad she had that sentiment. It goes with basically every outfit and is loud enough to let those who know that I am flexing on them, but subtle enough that the big graphic words make an otherwise plain outfit interesting to the average person. I have had this bag since January 2025.

            data-desc="LTTT Bungee Pants V.3 - Black
            –These pants were part of the aforementioned birthday celebration. I had seen these pants on their site a while ago when they first dropped and always really liked the plaid pocket detail. Initially, I wasn’t super crazy about the bungee cinching detail, but that has since become my favorite part about these pants. 

            –It took a little longer for this pair to arrive than it did for the ASICS pair because they originally sent me the black ASICS pants, which I desperately wanted to keep. LTTT’s customer service was very nice and personable - it felt quite pleasant coordinating the exchange. They even sent me a super cool tote to make up for the mixup. Much love to Kyle Chen. I have had these pants since August 2025.
